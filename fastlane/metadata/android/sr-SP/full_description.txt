openHAB - "оснажује ваш паметан дом" - кућна аутоматизација отвореног кода која је независна од произођача-добављача и технологије 

The builds on F-Droid have FCM removed and therefore won't be able to receive push notifications from openHAB Cloud. Instead, notifications are polled on a regular basis in these builds.

openHAB is a Java-based open-source home automation platform that integrates and combines a vast range of different smart home systems and technologies into one single solution.
On top of the unified abstraction layer all connected devices are available for the overarching automation rule engines and different user interfaces.
