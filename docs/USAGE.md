# Android App

The openHAB Android application is a native client for openHAB, compatible with phones and tablets.
The app follows the basic principles of the other openHAB UIs, like Basic UI, and presents your predefined openHAB [sitemap(s)](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/sitemaps.html).

## Getting Started

On first start the app tries to discover your openHAB server.
This will only work on local networks and when the server does not enforce either authentication or HTTPS.
If it fails, you can click on `Go to settings` and manually enter the server settings.

The URL field(s) might look like one of the following examples:

* IP address: `http://192.168.1.3:8080`
* Local hostname: `http://openhabianpi:8080` (depending on your network the suffix `.local` needs to be added to the hostname)
* Remote domain name: `https://myopenhab.org` for an openHAB cloud account with [myopenHAB](http://www.myopenhab.org/)

**Local server settings:**
Please enter the base URL of your openHAB server, as you would enter it in the browser to reach the openHAB dashboard.

**Remote server settings:**
If your openHAB instance is reachable via a public address/domain from outside your home network, these settings will be used when the local connection is not successful.
Make sure to secure this connection against unauthorized access.
There are a number of strategies available to provide [secure remote access]({{base}}/installation/security.html) to your openHAB server.

## Features

* Control your openHAB server and/or [openHAB Cloud instance](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-cloud), e.g., an account with [myopenHAB](http://www.myopenhab.org/)
* Receive notifications through an openHAB Cloud connection, [read more](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/actions.html#cloud-notification-actions)
* Change items via NFC tags
* Send voice commands to openHAB
* [Send device information to openHAB](#send-device-information-to-openhab), like next alarm clock time or call state
* [Supports wall mounted tablets](#permanent-deployment)
* [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) action plugin included

### Permanent Deployment

If you want to use openHAB Android on a wall mounted tablet, go to settings and select `Disable display timer` and `Fullscreen`.

### Send device information to openHAB

#### Alarm Clock

The openHAB app will send the next wake-up time from your alarm clock app to the server.
The time is sent as a number containing the number of milliseconds since the epoch.
The Item name's default is `AlarmClock`, but you can change it in the settings.

Example item definition:
```java
Number AlarmClock
```

Example rule:
```java
var Timer timerAlarm = null

rule "Alarm Clock"
when
    Item AlarmClock changed
then
    if (AlarmClock.state as Number == 0) {
        if (timerAlarm !== null) {
            timerAlarm.cancel
            timerAlarm = null
        }
        logInfo("alarm", "All alarms are cancelled")
    } else {
        var epoch = new DateTime((AlarmClock.state as Number).longValue)
        logInfo("alarm", "Scheduling alarm for " +  epoch.toString)

        if (timerAlarm !== null) {
            logInfo("alarm", "Reschedule alarm")
            timerAlarm.reschedule(epoch)
        } else {
            logInfo("alarm", "New Alarm")
            timerAlarm = createTimer(epoch,
                [ k |
                    // Turn on stuff, e.g. radio or light
                    Light.sendCommand(ON)
                    logInfo("alarm", "alarm is expired")
                ]
            )
        }
    }
end
```

#### Call State

The openHAB app will send the current call state to the server.

Example item definition:
```java
String CallState
```

Example rule:
```java
rule "Call State Trigger"
when
    Item CallState changed
then
    if (CallState.state == "IDLE") {
        // No call activity
    } else if (CallState.state == "RINGING") {
        // A new call arrived and is ringing or waiting. In the latter case, another call is already active.
    } else if (CallState.state == "OFFHOOK") {
        // At least one call exists that is dialing, active, or on hold, and no calls are ringing or waiting.
    }

end
```

#### Battery level

The openHAB app will send the current battery level to the server if you enable it in the settings.
While charging the battery level is sent every 10 to 15 minutes, otherwise every 2 to 6 hours.
In addition devices running Android 7 or lower send the level whenever the charger is plugged in or out or when the level changes between low and ok.

Example item definition:
```java
String BatteryLevel
```

Example rule:
```java
rule "Battery level changed"
when
    Item BatteryLevel changed
then
    if (BatteryLevel.state < 25) {
        // Battery level is low
    }

end
```

### Tasker Action Plugin

The Tasker Action Plugin can be used to send Item commands to the server.

For security reasons the plugin is disabled by default.
You can enable it by clicking on "Turn on" when trying to select an Item or go to the openHAB app settings and turn on "Tasker integration".

Variables can be selected as state after they have been created in the task.
The variable `%httpcode` is returned by the plugin and contains the HTTP code returned by the server.

In case of an error the plugin returns an error code.

| Error Code | Description                                                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10         | Tasker plugin is disabled                                                                  |
| 11         | The app couldn't establish a connection                                                    |
| 1000+      | A connection was established, but an error occured. The error code is 1000 + the HTTP code |

## Help and Technical Details

Please refer to the [openhab-android project on GitHub](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-android) for more details.

### I don't receive any notifications

Please have a look at the "Push notification status" on the About screen in the app.
If it claims that your device is successfully registered at FCM, please open an issue on [openhab-android project on GitHub](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-android) or create a thread in the forum.

### My notifications are delayed

All notifications are sent as "high priority" messages, which means that the device and the openHAB app are waken up and display the notification.
However vendors/third parties can implement custom "cleanup", "optimization" and "battery saver" apps, which might lead to delayed notifications.
Please have a look at [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) how to make an exception for openHAB in these apps.

### My voice command rule isn't run

Please make sure `Default Human Language Interpreter` is set to `Rule-based Interpreter` (http://openhab:8080/paperui/index.html#/configuration/system) and `Rule Voice Interpreter` => `Configure` => Select correct item (http://openhab:8080/paperui/index.html#/configuration/services?tab=voice).

### Chart loading is too slow

Generating charts can be taxing to the server.
If you experience slow chart loading times and your server isn't powerful, open `Settings` and disable `High resolution charts` to improve loading times.
