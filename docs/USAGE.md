# Android openHAB App

The openHAB Android application is a native client for openHAB. The app follows the basic principles of the other UIs, like Basic UI, and presents your predefined openHAB [sitemap(s)](http://docs.openhab.org/configuration/sitemaps.html).

## Getting Started

When first installed the app is in "Demo Mode".
To connect it to your own openHAB server, first navigate to Settings and uncheck the "Demo Mode" option.
Normally, after unchecking the Demo Mode, the app will be able to use multicast DNS to autodetect to your openHAB server if it is on the same network.

You also have the option to manually set the server URL in the settings.

**Local server settings:** Please enter the base URL to your openHAB server as you would enter it in the browser to reach the openHAB dashboard.

**Remote server settings:** If you want to use openHAB cloud, please enter URL, user and password of you cloud instance here. Please make sure to [secure this connection](http://docs.openhab.org/installation/security.html).

The URL might look like one of the following examples:

* IP address: `http://192.168.1.3:8080`
* Local DNS name: `http://openhabianpi:8080` respectively `http://openhabianpi.local:8080` (depending on your network)

Once the URL is set correctly, the display of the app will be determined by the sitemaps defined on your server.

The option to set a "Remote URL" allows the app to be used when you are away from home.
There are a number of strategies available to provide [secure remote access]({{base}}/installation/security.html) to your openHAB server.

## Permanent Deployment

If you want to use openHAB Android on a wall mounted tablet, go to settings and tick `Disable display timer` and `Full Screen`.
