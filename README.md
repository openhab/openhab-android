## Setting up development environment

If you want to contribute to Android application we are here to help you to set up development environment. openHAB Android app is developed using Android Studio and also can be build with maven.

- Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) Android -> SDK Manager
- Check out the latest code from Github via Android Studio
- Install SDKs and Gradle if you get asked
- Click on "Build Variants" on the left side and change the build variant of the module "mobile" to fullDebug

You are ready to contribute!

Before producing any amount of code please have a look at [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Build flavors

An optional build flavor "foss" is available for distribution through F-Droid. This build has map view, GCM and crash reporting removed and will not be able to receive push notifications from openHAB Cloud.

For using map view support in the "full" build flavor, you need to visit the [Maps API page](https://developers.google.com/maps/android) and generate an API key via the 'Get a key' button at the top. Then add a line in the following format to the 'gradle.properties' file (either in the same directory as this readme file, or in $HOME/.gradle): `mapsApiKey=<key>`, replacing `<key>` with the API key you just obtained.
